# 📝 Maze Solver

This project generates a random maze and solves it using recursive backtracking. The maze generation utilizes Depth-First Search (DFS) to carve out passages and create unique maze layouts for each run.

## ✏️ Features

- Uses DFS to generate a maze
- Random path carving to enhance maze complexity
- Maze generation visualization
- Recursive bactracking to solve the maze
- Interactive play mode

## 🧑🏽‍💻 How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed, like g++.
- The code is designed to run on Unix-like systems (Linux or macOS) due to the use of ANSI escape codes for terminal control. Windows might require a terminal that supports ANSI codes.

### Compile and Run

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:lnvaldez/maze-solver.git
$ cd maze-solver
$ g++ maze.cpp -o out
$ ./out
```
