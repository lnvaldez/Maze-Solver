<h1 align="center">Maze Solver Program</h1>

<p align="center">
  This repository contains a C++ program that generates a random maze and solves it using both Backtracking and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms. The maze generation utilizes Depth-First Search (DFS) to carve out passages and create a unique maze layout for each run.
</p>

<h2 align="center">Features</h2>

- **Maze Generation:** Randomized maze generation using DFS to carve out paths between walls.
- **Solver Algorithms:**
  - **Backtracking:** A recursive algorithm that explores all possible paths until it finds the exit.
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** An iterative algorithm that explores the shortest path to the maze exit.
- **Console Visualization:** Real-time visualization of maze generation and solving progress in the terminal/console.
- **ANSI Colors:** Utilizes ANSI escape sequences for colorful maze visualization (e.g., red path).

<h2 align="center">Usage</h2>

- **Compilation:** Compile the C++ source code (`maze_solver.cpp`) using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
- **Execution:** Run the compiled executable to generate and solve a random maze.
- **Navigation:** Use arrow keys to navigate through the maze during solving visualization.

<h2 align="center">Requirements</h2>

- C++ Compiler (supporting C++11 or higher)
- Standard Library (iostream, vector, algorithm, etc.)
- ANSI-compatible terminal/console for proper visualization (optional)
